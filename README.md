*Starwars 1*
Create a React web application that consumes the https://swapi.dev/api/people/ API and displays a dropdown containing a list of Star Wars characters. When a user selects a character from the dropdown, the application should make an API call to fetch the films the character has appeared in and the vehicles they have used, and display them in a table.
